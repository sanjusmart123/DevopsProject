what is replay in jenkins:

In Jenkins, Replay refers to a feature that allows users to replay a job or a set of jobs on demand.
This feature is useful for debugging and testing purposes, as it enables you to simulate the execution of a job or a series of jobs without affecting the actual build results.
Upon replay, Jenkins will run the specified jobs in the same environment as the original run, with the same input parameters and configurations. 
This allows you to reproduce issues or verify fixes without affecting the production environment.

Suppose you have a pipeline that failed due to a configuration issue in the Jenkinsfile.
Instead of modifying the Jenkinsfile in your version control system, pushing the changes, and running a new build, you can use Replay to:

Modify the script to fix the issue.
Run the pipeline with the new script to verify the fix.
Once confirmed, you can update the Jenkinsfile in version control with the fix.
