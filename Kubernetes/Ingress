ingress in kubernetes

In Kubernetes, an Ingress is a centralized point of entry for incoming HTTP requests. 
It allows multiple services to be accessed through a single IP and port. 
The Ingress resource is responsible for routing incoming traffic to the relevant service, allowing for load balancing, SSL termination, 
and hostname-based routing. An Ingress controller forwards incoming requests to the corresponding service within the cluster.
This facilitates a scalable and maintainable way to manage incoming traffic in Kubernetes applications.

Kubernetes Ingress is an API object that helps developers expose their applications and 
manage external access by providing http/s routing rules to the services within a Kubernetes cluster.

In Kubernetes, Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services within a cluster, typically HTTP and HTTPS routes. 
It provides a way to expose multiple services over the same IP address and route traffic based on hostnames or paths. 
Essentially, Ingress acts as a more flexible and powerful alternative to other options like NodePort or LoadBalancer services.

Egress:

In Kubernetes, egress refers to the outbound traffic originating from pods within the cluster to external resources or services, either within or outside the cluster
Egress traffic is used to access external services such as databases, APIs, and other services running outside of the cluster

Egress in Kubernetes refers to the flow of traffic from a pod or service in a cluster to an external network, such as the internet or another Kubernetes cluster. 
This can include accessing external services, making API calls, or communicating with other systems outside of the cluster.
Egress traffic is typically managed by Kubernetes' network policies, which control what traffic is allowed to exit the cluster.
By default, egress traffic is not restricted, but network policies can be used to limit or restrict egress traffic based on various criteria, such as IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
