Manual scheduling in Kubernetes refers to the process of directly assigning a Pod to a specific node in the cluster without relying on Kubernetes' default scheduler. 
This approach bypasses the automated decision-making of the scheduler and is useful for testing, debugging, or scenarios where precise control is required.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  nodeName: node1
The Pod will be scheduled directly on the node named node1.
If node1 is unavailable or does not have sufficient resources, the Pod will remain in a Pending state.
