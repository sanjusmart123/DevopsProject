ClusterIP assigns internal IP addresses for intra-cluster communication, NodePort exposes applications 
to external clients via specific ports on worker nodes, and LoadBalancer provides publicly accessible IP addresses for external traffic distribution.


In Kubernetes, NodePort and LoadBalancer are two methods to access applications deployed on a cluster from outside. 
NodePort exposes a service on a specific port on each node in the cluster, making it accessible from outside. 
LoadBalancer, on the other hand, uses an external cloud provider's load balancer to distribute traffic across nodes. 
NodePort is simpler to set up but provides less scalability and security, while LoadBalancer offers better scalability and security at the cost of more complex setup. 
Choose NodePort for small-scale applications and LoadBalancer for large-scale, high-traffic deployments.
