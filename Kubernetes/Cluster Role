In Kubernetes, a Cluster Role is a set of permissions that define what actions a user or service account can perform within a cluster.
It's essentially a collection of verbs (actions) that can be applied to a set of resource types, such as pods, services, or persistent volumes. 
Cluster Roles are used to manage access control and ensure that resources are only accessed and modified by authorized entities. 
They are often associated with Service Accounts, which are used to authenticate and authorize processes running within a pod.

Cluster Role Binding:
To assign this ClusterRole to a specific user, group, or service account, you use a ClusterRoleBinding.
This binding allows you to specify who can use the defined permissions in the ClusterRole.
