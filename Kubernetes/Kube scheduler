kube-scheduler is responsible for scheduling pods on nodes.
The kube-scheduler is only responsible for deciding which pod goes on which node. 
It doesn't actually place the pod on the nodes, that's the job of the kubelet.

The Kube Scheduler is a primary component of the Kubernetes control plane that responsible for assigning containerized applications to available resources in a cluster.
It is often referred to as the "traffic cop" for Kubernetes. 
The Scheduler ensures that Pods are created on a suitable node with the necessary resources and availability.
Upon receiving a Pod creation request, the Scheduler calculates a list of suitable nodes and assigns the Pod to the most suitable node based on factors such as resource availability, node affinity, and anti-affinity.
