By default, Kubernetes tries to schedule a pod on any available node unless the node has a taint that prevents this.
Taint:

A taint is a label applied to a node that affects the pod scheduling decision
In Kubernetes, Taints and Tolerations work together to control the scheduling of pods to nodes. 
They help ensure that specific pods are either allowed or prevented from running on certain nodes,
based on custom conditions or node-specific requirements.

"kubectl taint nodes node01 key=value:NoSchedule"  ---> This means no pod will be scheduled on node1 unless it has a toleration for this taint

 kubectl taint nodes node01 key=value:NoSchedule-
 - is used to untaint the node

Effect options:

NoSchedule: New pods that do not tolerate this taint cannot be scheduled on this node.
PreferNoSchedule: The system tries to avoid scheduling new pods that do not tolerate this taint, but it’s not guaranteed.
NoExecute: New pods and existing pods that do not tolerate this taint will be evicted or won’t be scheduled.

Tolerations:
A toleration is applied to pods to allow them to tolerate specific taints on nodes, 
meaning they can be scheduled on nodes that have matching taints.

Tolerations allow pods to "tolerate" the taints applied to nodes.

tolerations:
- key: "key"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value"
  effect: "NoSchedule"



Taints are applied to nodes to control pod scheduling, either preventing pods from being scheduled or evicting them.
Tolerations are applied to pods to allow them to bypass taints and run on nodes with specific taints.

############################################################################################################################
Only pods which are tolerant to the particular taint on a node will get scheduled on that node.

kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule

To see this taint, run the below command
kubectl describe node kubemaster |grep Taint

Tolerations are added to pods by adding a tolerations section in pod definition


The pod is assigned to node1,But for example avaiables nodes have same taint,in this case we should use node selectors

kubectl label nodes node1 size=Large

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: myapp-pod
spec:
 containers:
 - name: nginx-container
   image: nginx
 tolerations:
 - key: "app"
   operator: "Equal"
   value: "blue"
   effect: "NoSchedule"
 nodeSelector:
  size: Large

This ensures the pod is scheduled only on nodes with the label size=Large.
myapp-pod is assigned to node1  when match the taint and label ,but here there is a issue, for example e have 2 nodes both nodes also have same taints and node selctors,i
in this case pod will assigned to available node

but we should assign a pod to specific node,this is our main goal so here we should go with Node affinity

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: myapp-pod
spec:
 containers:
 - name: nginx-container 
   image: nginx
 tolerations:
 - key: "app"
   operator: "Equal"
   value: "blue"
   effect: "NoSchedule"
 nodeSelector:
  size: Large
 affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions: 
        - key: node-ip
          operator: In
          values: 
          - 192.7.54.6 

Here we have specified ip address of our specific node so this pod will assigned to specific node 
if this ip address is not matched to any node the pod is on pending state

requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
This is a hard constraint: the pod must be scheduled on a node that satisfies the condition.
If no nodes meet the criteria, the pod won't be scheduled.

preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
This is a soft constraint: the scheduler will prefer nodes that satisfy the condition but will still schedule the pod on other nodes if none meet the criteria.
