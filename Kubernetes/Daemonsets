A DaemonSet is a type of Kubernetes object that ensures a copy of a pod is running on every node in a cluster.
It is used to run a service on every node, such as a monitoring agent, a logging collector, or a network daemon.
DaemonSets are useful for running long-running tasks that require access to the node's resources, like disk storage or network interfaces.
They can also be used to maintain a consistent state across all nodes in the cluster. DaemonSets are created by submitting a DaemonSet manifest to the Kubernetes API.

Runs Pods on Every Node:

A DaemonSet automatically schedules one pod on every eligible node in the cluster.
Dynamic Updates:

If new nodes are added to the cluster, the DaemonSet automatically schedules the pod on those nodes.
Similarly, if a node is removed, its associated pod is deleted.
Selectors for Node Targeting:

DaemonSets can target specific nodes using node selectors, node affinity, or taints and tolerations.
Immutable Updates:

Updating a DaemonSet (e.g., changing its image) requires rolling out changes to all nodes.

Monitoring and Logging Agents:

Tools like Prometheus Node Exporter, Fluentd, or Datadog that collect node-specific metrics or logs.
Networking and Security:

Services like CNI plugins, VPN agents, or firewall configurations.
Cluster Administration:

System-level tasks like garbage collection, resource monitoring, or node-level configuration.
