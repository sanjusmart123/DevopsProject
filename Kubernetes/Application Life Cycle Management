Rolling Updates and Rollbacks in Deployments:

A Rolling Update is a deployment strategy that allows you to update the application in a way that replaces old versions of the application with new versions gradually,
without causing downtime. The key idea is to update pods one at a time or in small batches, ensuring that the application remains available throughout the update process

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1          # Allow one additional pod to be created during the update
      maxUnavailable: 25%  # Allow 25% of the pods to be unavailable during the update
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app-container
          image: my-app:v2
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080

maxSurge: 1: Allows one extra pod to be created during the update, which helps minimize downtime.
maxUnavailable: 25%: Allows up to 25% of the pods to be unavailable during the update process.

Kubernetes starts by creating the new version of the application and scaling up the new pods (subject to the maxSurge setting).
The old version of the application continues running during the update process, ensuring that the number of available pods is maintained.
Once the new pod(s) are healthy (according to readiness/liveness checks), Kubernetes scales down the old version (subject to the maxUnavailable setting).
The process continues until all the old pods are replaced by the new version.
This process ensures that the application remains available and responsive during the update.

A Rollback is a process of reverting to a previous version of a deployment if something goes wrong during the rolling update or if the new version causes issues in production.

How Rollbacks Work:
Automatic Rollback: Kubernetes supports automatic rollbacks if the health checks (readiness/liveness probes) fail or if the deployment doesn't proceed as expected.
It will revert the deployment to the previous stable version.
Manual Rollback: You can also manually trigger a rollback to a specific version using the kubectl rollout undo command.

Check the Deployment History: Kubernetes keeps a history of previous deployments, 
and you can use the kubectl rollout history command to view the history of a deployment and find the previous revision.

kubectl rollout history deployment/my-app

Rollback to Previous Version: Use the kubectl rollout undo command to roll back to the previous revision.
kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-app

If you want to roll back to a specific revision:
kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-app --to-revision=2

Sleep command:
Pod Lifecycle Testing: You can use sleep to test Kubernetes Pod scheduling, rolling updates, and termination behaviors. 
A long sleep period helps test how the system handles Pods that run for an extended time or are stuck in a state (for example, simulating a "hanging" container).
Kubernetes Readiness and Liveness Probes: During testing, sleep can be useful for verifying the effectiveness of Kubernetes health checks. 
You can experiment with liveness and readiness probes by configuring them to check the container's state while it sleeps for a long period.

Background or Asynchronous Jobs: In many production environments, certain jobs run in the background, such as batch processing, cron jobs, or other asynchronous tasks.
The sleep command can simulate this scenario, where a container stays idle but doesn't exit until it is manually terminated or the sleep duration ends.
Workload Simulation: If you want to simulate background workloads that don’t have a predefined end, sleep can be a simple placeholder while you work on building or testing a more complex service.

apiVersion: v1                # API version used to define the object.
kind: Pod                      # The kind of resource; in this case, a Pod.
metadata:
  name: ubuntu-sleeper-3       # Name of the Pod, you can reference it within the Kubernetes cluster.
spec:
  containers:                  # Specifies the container configuration within the Pod.
  - name: ubuntu               # The name of the container inside the Pod.
    image: ubuntu              # The Docker image to be used for the container, here it's the official Ubuntu image.
    command:                   # The command to run inside the container (overrides the default command in the image).
      - "sleep"                # The command that runs when the container starts.
      - "2000"                 # The argument passed to the sleep command; the container will sleep for 2000 seconds.

Configure Environment Variables In Applications:

Environment variables (often abbreviated as env) are crucial in Kubernetes, Docker, and many application deployments. They are used to configure application behavior, store sensitive information,
Configuration Management:

Externalize Configuration: Store configuration settings such as database URLs, API keys, or application parameters in environment variables to keep them separate from the application code. 
This makes it easier to modify configurations without changing the codebase.

env:
  - name: DATABASE_URL
    value: "postgres://user:password@host/dbname

Environment-Specific Configuration: 
Use environment variables to distinguish between different environments (development, testing, production). For instance, use APP_ENV to define the environment type and load different settings accordingly.

env:
  - name: APP_ENV
    value: "production"

Security & Sensitive Information:

Store Secrets: Rather than hard-coding sensitive information (such as passwords, API tokens, or private keys) directly in the application or source code, you can store them as environment variables. Kubernetes has a built-in resource type called Secrets for this purpose, which can be mapped to environment variables.
Example: Using Kubernetes secrets to inject sensitive data.

env:
  - name: DB_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: mysecret
        key: password

Environment variables are a flexible and powerful way to control the configuration, behavior, and security of your applications in Kubernetes. 
They allow you to decouple the configuration from your application code, support different environments, manage secrets securely, and provide fine-grained control over application behavior.

ConfigMaps in Kubernetes are used to store configuration data as key-value pairs. 
Storing configuration data such as environment variables, config files, command-line arguments


kubectl create configmap my-config --from-literal=key1=value1 --from-literal=key2=value2

kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=path/to/configfile --> created from a file


##################################
Inject configmap in pod

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  APP_COLOR: blue
  APP_MODE: prod
kubectl create -f pod-definition.yaml


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: simple-webapp-color
spec:
 containers:
 - name: simple-webapp-color
   image: simple-webapp-color
   ports:
   - containerPort: 8080
   envFrom:
   - configMapRef:
       name: app-config

Create a config map definition file and run the 'kubectl create` command to deploy it.
kubectl create -f config-map.yaml

 kubectl get configmaps (or)
 kubectl get cm

kubectl describe configmaps

Secretes:

A Secret is used to store sensitive information, such as passwords, tokens, or keys. While data in a Secret is also stored as key-value pairs, it is base64-encoded, not encrypted by default (though encryption at rest can be enabled).

Use case: Storing sensitive data like database credentials, API keys, SSL certificates, etc.
Format: Base64-encoded data, though you should treat it as confidential information.

kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=username=admin --from-literal=password='s3cr3t'

kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-file=path/to/secretfile

Yaml file:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=   # base64 encoded value of 'admin'
  password: c2VjcmV0   # base64 encoded value of 'secret'


echo -n 'admin' | base64
echo -n 'secrete' | base64   --->to convert encoded

echo -n 'serty45' | base64 --decode


Accessing secrete from env:

env:
- name: SECRET_USERNAME
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: my-secret
      key: username

from Volumes:

volumes:
  - name: secret-volume
    secret:
      secretName: my-secret

###################################################################################################################
Multi-container-Pods:

In Kubernetes, multi-container pods are used to deploy multiple containers within the same pod. 
Each container in the pod shares the same network namespace (i.e., they can communicate with each other via localhost), 
and they are co-located, sharing resources like volumes, which makes multi-container pods useful for specific use cases where containers need to work together. 

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: simple-webapp
  labels:
    name: simple-webapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: simple-webapp
    image: simple-webapp
    ports:
    - ContainerPort: 8080
  - name: log-agent
    image: log-agent
##################################

Sidecar Pattern
Description: The sidecar pattern involves running a helper container alongside the main application container. 
The sidecar container provides supplementary functionality, such as logging, monitoring, or proxying, which supports the main application.
Use Case: A typical use case is running a logging agent (like Fluentd or Filebeat) alongside a web application container.
The logging container collects logs and forwards them to a logging service or stores them in a centralized system.

Example: A pod with a main web application and a sidecar logging container:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-with-logging
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app-container
    image: my-app
  - name: logging-agent
    image: fluentd
    volumeMounts:
    - name: logs
      mountPath: /var/log
  volumes:
  - name: logs
    emptyDir: {}

####################################################################################################
Init Containers:

Init Containers in Kubernetes are specialized containers that run before the main application containers in a pod.
They allow you to perform initialization tasks that must complete before the main containers start running.
Init containers run sequentially, and each init container must finish successfully before the next one starts. 
If any init container fails, Kubernetes will restart the pod until the initialization succeeds.

Use Case: For example, you might need to set up a configuration file or initialize a database schema before the main application container can start handling traffic.
Benefit: This ensures that the main container only starts once all the necessary initialization tasks have been completed successfully.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-with-db-init
spec:
  initContainers:
  - name: db-init
    image: db-init-image
    command: ["sh", "-c", "echo 'CREATE DATABASE mydb;' | mysql -h db_host"]
  containers:
  - name: main-app
    image: my-app
