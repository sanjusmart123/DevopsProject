There are 5 types of services:
ClusterIP
NodePort
LoadBalancer
External Name
Headless

ClusterIP:

ClusterIP is the default service type in Kubernetes. 
It exposes the service on an internal IP address within the Kubernetes cluster, making it accessible only from within the cluster.
This is useful for internal services that do not need to be exposed to external traffic.

How ClusterIP Works
When you create a ClusterIP service, Kubernetes allocates an IP address for the service within the cluster. 
This IP is only reachable from within the cluster, and the service routes traffic to the pods that match the service's selector.

Pod yaml file:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.21
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx  # Label selector to find the pods this service will expose
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80        # Port to access the service
      targetPort: 8080  # Port on the pod that the service will forward traffic to
  type: ClusterIP  # The type of service (defaults to ClusterIP)

####################################################
NodePort:

In Kubernetes, a NodePort is a type of service that exposes a container's port on each machine (node) in a cluster. 
It allows external traffic to access the service directly by using a static port number on each node. 
NodePorts are typically used for development environments, testing, and demos. When a NodePort is created,
Kubernetes allocates a unique port number on each node's exposed ports (30000-32767) and maps it to the container's port.
This allows clients to access the service using the node's IP and the allocated port number.

A NodePort is a type of service in Kubernetes that exposes your application on a specific port on each node in your cluster. 
This allows external traffic to access your application by using the IP address of any node in the cluster along with the specified port.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nodeport-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30007

What is a kube-proxy?
Kube-Proxy and CNI: The Hidden Components of Kubernetes ...
Kube-Proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster.
It is responsible for maintaining network connectivity between services and pods.
Kube-Proxy does this by translating service definitions into actionable networking rules
################################################################
Load Balancer:

A LoadBalancer service in Kubernetes is used to expose a service to external traffic by provisioning a load balancer provided by the underlying cloud infrastructure (like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.).
This type of service automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple pods and ensures high availability and fault tolerance for your application.

How LoadBalancer Works
When you create a LoadBalancer service, Kubernetes requests a cloud provider to provision an external load balancer. 
The load balancer receives incoming traffic and forwards it to the backend pods associated with the service.

External Load Balancer:

Typically provisioned by a cloud provider.
Distributes traffic from external clients (e.g., the internet) to services running within the Kubernetes cluster.
Example: AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Google Cloud Load Balancer, Azure Load Balancer.

Internal Load Balancer:

Distributes traffic within a private network or between services inside a cluster.
Often used for communication between microservices.

It automatically provisions an external load balancer when you create a Service of type LoadBalancer.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-api-deployment
  labels:
    app: my-api
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-api
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-api-container
        image: my-api-image:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-api-loadbalancer-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-api
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer


An external load balancer is created.
It forwards traffic from port 80 of the load balancer to port 8080 on the Pods matching the selector app: my-app.

#######################################################################
External Name:

Description: Maps a Service to an external DNS name.
Use Case: For redirecting traffic to services outside the Kubernetes cluster.
Access: Resolves to the specified external DNS name.
Example:
yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-externalname-service
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: example.com

Does not define a Pod selector.
Useful for integrating with external databases or third-party services.

#####################################################################
Headless Service:

A Headless Service in Kubernetes is a specialized type of Service that does not assign a ClusterIP. 
Instead, it provides direct access to the individual Pods associated with it. 
This is typically used for stateful applications or scenarios where you need Pods to be accessed directly by their DNS names or IP addresses.

Statefulset yaml file:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  serviceName: my-headless-service
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: my-app-image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080



apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-headless-service
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080

For applications where each instance (Pod) must be uniquely addressable, such as databases or message brokers.
Commonly paired with StatefulSets to manage stateful applications, like databases (e.g., Cassandra, MySQL, Elasticsearch), where each Pod has a unique identity.
Unlike standard Services, Kubernetes does not use kube-proxy to route traffic for a Headless Service.
Unlike regular Services, a Headless Service does not load-balance requests across Pods.
Instead, it provides direct DNS resolution to the Pods behind it.
You specify clusterIP: None in the Service definition to create a Headless Service.
Each Pod in a Headless Service gets its own unique DNS record.
