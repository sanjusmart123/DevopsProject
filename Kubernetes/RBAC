In Kubernetes, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of controlling access to cluster resources based on a user's identity and role. 
It allows administrators to define roles and bind them to users or service accounts, granting specific permissions and privileges. 
RBAC provides a way to manage fine-grained access control within the cluster, ensuring that users only have access to resources and actions they need to perform their tasks.
RBAC can be used to enforce policies, monitor activity, and maintain the overall security and integrity of the cluster.
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of protecting sensitive data from improper access, modification, addition, or deletion. 
It allows employees to have access to the information required to fulfill their responsibilities.
Role-based access control (RBAC) objects determine whether a user is allowed to perform a given action within a project. 
Cluster administrators can use the cluster roles and bindings to control who has various access levels to the OpenShift Container Platform platform itself and all projects.

Role:
###############
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
#####################################
API group with an empty string ("") refers to the core API.
Resources in the core API include:
pods
services
nodes
configmaps
namespaces

Named API Groups:

Non-core resources are part of named API groups.
Named groups help modularize Kubernetes by separating features into logical domains.
Example API groups include:
apps (e.g., Deployments, StatefulSets)
rbac.authorization.k8s.io (e.g., Roles, RoleBindings)
batch (e.g., Jobs, CronJobs)

########################
The next step is to link the user to that role.
For this we create another object called RoleBinding. This role binding object links a user object to a role.
Bind The Role to the user:
#######################
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods-binding
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: "jane"  # This is the user to whom you're giving permissions
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
