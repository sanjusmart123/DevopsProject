In Kubernetes, a multiple scheduler refers to the ability to run multiple scheduler components simultaneously to manage and schedule containerized applications. 
This allows for more efficient resource utilization, improved scalability, and increased flexibility. With multiple schedulers, 
you can configure different scheduling strategies for different workloads, such as using one scheduler for batch jobs and another for stateful applications. 
Additionally, multiple schedulers can help improve high availability and redundancy by providing a fallback option in case one scheduler becomes unavailable.

Some common use cases for multiple schedulers in Kubernetes include:
Running a primary scheduler for production workloads and a secondary scheduler for development or testing environments
Using one scheduler for stateless applications and another for stateful applications
Implementing a canary deployment strategy using multiple
