Prometheus and Grafana are two popular open-source tools used in monitoring and observability.
Prometheus is a monitoring system and time series database that collects metrics from applications and services. 
It provides a query language (PromQL) for retrieving and aggregating data. 
Grafana, on the other hand, is a visualization platform that uses Prometheus data to create dashboards, graphs, and charts. 
While Prometheus focuses on collecting and storing data, Grafana focuses on visualizing and analyzing that data.

It’s a powerful tool for creating real-time monitoring dashboards.
Grafana connects to Prometheus as a data source and provides a flexible interface to visualize those metrics through dashboards.
Together, they form a powerful combination for monitoring and observability, especially in cloud-native environments like Kubernetes.
In short, Prometheus is the data collector, and Grafana is the data viewer.

Why is Observability Important?
Proactive Monitoring: Detect and respond to issues before they impact users.
Faster Troubleshooting: Identify the root cause of problems using detailed logs and traces.
Performance Optimization: Analyze trends to optimize system performance and resource utilization.
Business Insights: Understand the overall health of the system and its impact on business metrics like SLAs or SLOs.
Key Tools for Observability:
Prometheus (Metrics)

For collecting and querying time-series data, such as CPU and memory usage.
Grafana (Visualization)

For visualizing data from various sources, including Prometheus, Elasticsearch, and others.
Elasticsearch + Kibana (Logs)

Elasticsearch for indexing and storing logs, Kibana for visualizing and analyzing them.
Jaeger or Zipkin (Tracing)
