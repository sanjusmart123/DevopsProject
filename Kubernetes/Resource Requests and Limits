In Kubernetes, resource requests and resource limits are used to manage the CPU and memory resources allocated to containers in a cluster.

1. Resource Requests
A resource request specifies the minimum amount of resources that a container is guaranteed to have available to it. 
When a container is scheduled onto a node, Kubernetes ensures that the node has at least the requested amount of CPU and memory available.
If a node doesn’t have the requested resources, the container won't be scheduled there.

resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
This means the container requests at least 256Mi of memory and 0.5 CPU cores.

2. Resource Limits
A resource limit specifies the maximum amount of resources that a container is allowed to use. If a container tries to exceed these limit.

resources:
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "1"
This means the container can use a maximum of 512Mi of memory and up to 1 CPU core.
