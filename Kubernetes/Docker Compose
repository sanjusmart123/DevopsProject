Docker Compose is a powerful tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
It allows you to define the services, networks, and volumes required for your application using a YAML configuration file.
With Docker Compose, you can easily start, stop, and manage your containers, as well as link containers together to create a fully functional application.
It simplifies the development and deployment process by providing a more intuitive and efficient way to manage complex Docker setups.
