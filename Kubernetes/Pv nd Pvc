apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: my-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"

capacity: Specifies the size of the storage, in this case, 10Gi.
accessModes: Defines how the volume can be accessed. ReadWriteOnce means it can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Determines what happens to the PV when the PVC is deleted.
Retain means the data is retained after the PVC is deleted.
storageClassName: Associates the PV with a storage class. If you don’t want to use storage classes, you can omit this or set it to "manual".
hostPath: Defines the actual storage location on the host machine for testing purposes.
In production, you might use other storage types like NFS, AWS EBS, GCE PD, etc.




apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi

Use the PVC in a Pod
Once the PVC is bound to a PV, you can use the PVC in a pod to mount the storage.

#######################################################
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container

    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
      name: my-storage
  volumes:
  - name: my-storage
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: my-pvc



accessModes: Should match one of the access modes specified in the PV.
resources: Specifies the amount of storage requested. This should be equal to or less than the capacity of the PV.
storageClassName: This should match the storageClassName defined in the PV.
If storageClassName is not specified, it will bind to a PV without a storage class or to the default storage class.

pv in kubernetes

PV stands for Persistent Volumes in Kubernetes. 
It is a resource that provides persistent storage to pods.
PVs are managed by the cluster and are decoupled from pods, ensuring that when a pod is deleted or recreated, the data stored in the PV is preserved.
PVs can be provisioned statically by cluster administrators or dynamically through storage classes.
They can be attached to pods using Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) and can be used for storing applications' data, logs, or other persistent data.

pvc in kubernetes

PVC (Persistent Volumes Claim) is a Kubernetes feature that allows you to request storage resources from a cluster.
A PVC is a request for storage that is provisioned and managed by a cluster administrator. 
Once a PVC is created, it can be bound to a Persistent Volume (PV), which is a resource in the cluster 
that represents a piece of networked storage. PVCs provide a way to decouple storage from the deployment of an application, 
allowing for more flexibility and scalability in the deployment of stateful applications.

PVs can be provisioned through the statically or dynamically.
static provisioning involves creating PVs in advance,
while dynamic provisioning allows Pvs to be created on-demand when requested by the application.

Dynamic Provisioning of PVs facilitated through the use of storage classes

when pvc created,kubernetes dynamically binds it to an available pv that matches the requirements specified in the claim


storage class in kubernetes

In Kubernetes, a storage class is a way to request storage with specific characteristics, such as type and size, without explicitly specifying the underlying Persistent Volumes (PVs).
When a Pod requests storage, Kubernetes creates a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) and binds it to a matching PV.
This decouples the application from the storage infrastructure, allowing for easier scaling and flexibility. 
Storage classes can be used to provision storage from various sources, such as local disks, NFS, or object storage like Amazon S3. 
They provide a standardized way to interact with storage resources in Kubernetes.
