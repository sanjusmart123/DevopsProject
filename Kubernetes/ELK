Elk is a popular log collection and analysis tool commonly used in Kubernetes environments. ELK stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. 
Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine, Logstash is a data processing tool, and Kibana is a data visualization platform.
In Kubernetes, ELK is often used to collect and analyze logs from containerized applications. 
This helps developers and operators troubleshoot issues, monitor performance, and gain insights into application behavior. 
By integrating ELK into Kubernetes, teams can streamline log management and gain real-time visibility into their applications' behavior.
When deployed in Kubernetes, ELK can be used to collect, store, and analyze logs and metrics from various applications running in the Kubernetes cluster.

Why Use ELK in Kubernetes?
1.Centralized Log Management: ELK provides a centralized solution for collecting, storing, and analyzing logs from all applications running in a Kubernetes cluster.
2.Scalability: Both Kubernetes and ELK are designed to be highly scalable, making it easy to handle large volumes of log data.
3.Data Visualization: Kibana allows for real-time visualization of log data, helping developers and operators understand the state and performance of their applications.
4.Search and Analysis: Elasticsearch's powerful search capabilities enable quick retrieval and analysis of log data.
