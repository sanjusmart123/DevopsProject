In Python, a linear search, also known as a sequential search, is an algorithm that finds a specific value of index in a list by checking each item one by one.

def linear_search(arr,target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
arr=[1,2,5,6,7,8,3]
target=8
result = linear_search(arr,target)
if result != -1:
    print('element found at index:',result)
else:
    print("Not found")
