# Set an environment variable
os.environ['MY_ENV_VAR'] = 'value'

# List files in the current directory
files = os.listdir('.')
print(files)

# Remove a file
os.remove('file_to_remove.txt')

# Create a directory
os.makedirs('new_dir/sub_dir', exist_ok=True)

Path.exists(): Checks if the path exists.
Path.is_file(): Checks if the path is a file.
Path.mkdir(): Creates a directory.

from pathlib import Path

# Create a Path object
path = Path('/some/directory')

# Check if a path exists
if not path.exists():
    path.mkdir(parents=True)

# Iterate over files in a directory
for file in path.iterdir():
    print(file)

json.load(fp): Parses JSON data from a file into Python data structures.
json.loads(s): Parses JSON data from a string.
json.dump(obj, fp): Writes Python data structures to a JSON file.
json.dumps(obj): Converts Python data structures to a JSON string.

import json

# Load JSON from a file
with open('config.json', 'r') as file:
    config = json.load(file)

# Access data from the JSON
print(config['key'])

# Write data to a JSON file
data = {'key': 'value', 'list': [1, 2, 3]}
with open('output.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(data, file, indent=4)

##########################################
configparser
Purpose: The configparser module is used for working with INI-style configuration files. It allows you to read, write, and modify configuration files in a structured way.
Common Functions:
configparser.ConfigParser(): Creates a new configuration parser object.
parser.read(filenames): Reads configuration from a file or list of files.
parser.get(section, option): Retrieves a value from the configuration.
parser.set(section, option, value): Sets a value in the configuration.

import configparser

# Create a ConfigParser object
config = configparser.ConfigParser()

# Read configuration from a file
config.read('config.ini')

# Access a configuration value
db_host = config['database']['host']
print(db_host)

# Modify and save the configuration
config['database']['host'] = 'new_host'
with open('config.ini', 'w') as configfile:
    config.write(configfile)

Terraform and Python Integration
Terraform is a popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. Although Terraform itself is not written in Python, you can interact with Terraform through Python scripts using various libraries and techniques.

Python Libraries for Terraform
python-terraform

Purpose: python-terraform is a Python wrapper for Terraform commands. It allows you to programmatically execute Terraform operations such as init, plan, apply, and destroy from within a Python script.

Installation: Install via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install python-terraform
Common Methods:

Terraform.init(): Runs the terraform init command to initialize a Terraform working directory.
Terraform.plan(): Runs terraform plan to create an execution plan.
Terraform.apply(): Runs terraform apply to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration.
Terraform.destroy(): Runs terraform destroy to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure.
Example:


from python_terraform import Terraform, IsFlagged

# Initialize Terraform
tf = Terraform()
tf.init()

# Create an execution plan
return_code, stdout, stderr = tf.plan()

# Apply the plan
return_code, stdout, stderr = tf.apply(skip_plan=True)

# Destroy the infrastructure
return_code, stdout, stderr = tf.destroy(force=IsFlagged)
Advantages:

Automates the running of Terraform commands within Python scripts.
Allows the integration of Terraform into larger Python automation workflows.
Use Cases:

Automating the deployment of infrastructure from within a CI/CD pipeline.
