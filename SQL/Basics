SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to communicate with and manage relational databases. 
It allows users to perform tasks such as querying data, updating records, deleting records, and creating or modifying database structures. 
SQL is widely used in database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and SQLite.

Key Features of SQL:
Data Retrieval (Querying): Fetch data from databases using SELECT statements.
Data Manipulation: Insert (INSERT), update (UPDATE), and delete (DELETE) data in tables.
Data Definition: Create (CREATE), modify (ALTER), and drop (DROP) tables and other database objects.
Data Control: Manage access to the database using GRANT and REVOKE.
Transaction Control: Ensure data integrity with commands like COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT

Some of The Most Important SQL Commands
SELECT - extracts data from a database
UPDATE - updates data in a database
DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index

Semicolon after SQL Statements?
Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement 
to be executed in the same call to the server.

Select all records from the Customers table:

The SQL SELECT Statement
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Return data from the Customers table:

SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;

1.SELECT * FROM Customers; #to retrieve all the data

2.The SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement
The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Select all the different countries from the "Customers" table:

SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

SELECT Example Without DISTINCT
If you omit the DISTINCT keyword, the SQL statement returns the "Country" value from all the records of the "Customers" table:

Example
SELECT Country FROM Customers;

Count Distinct
By using the DISTINCT keyword in a function called COUNT, we can return the number of different countries.

Example
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;

Operators in The WHERE Clause
You can use other operators than the = operator to filter the search.

Example
Select all customers with a CustomerID greater than 80:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID > 80;
The following operators can be used in the WHERE clause:

Operator	Description	Example
=	Equal	
>	Greater than	
<	Less than	
>=	Greater than or equal	
<=	Less than or equal	
<>	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=	
BETWEEN	Between a certain range	
LIKE	Search for a pattern	
IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column

4.The SQL ORDER BY
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
Sort the products by price:

SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY Price;

3.The SQL WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.

It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
Select all customers from Mexico:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico'; 
The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.!
Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields
SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes).

However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID=1;

DESC
The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.
Sort the products from highest to lowest price:

SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY Price DESC;

Order Alphabetically
For string values the ORDER BY keyword will order alphabetically:

Example
Sort the products alphabetically by ProductName:

SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY ProductName;

Alphabetically DESC
To sort the table reverse alphabetically, use the DESC keyword:
Sort the products by ProductName in reverse order:

SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY ProductName DESC;

ORDER BY Several Columns
The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" and the "CustomerName" column. This means that it orders by Country, but if some rows have the same Country, it orders them by CustomerName:
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;

Using Both ASC and DESC
The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted ascending by the "Country" and descending by the "CustomerName" column:
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;

5.The SQL AND Operator
The WHERE clause can contain one or many AND operators.
The AND operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition, like if you want to return all customers from Spain that starts with the letter 'G':
Select all customers from Spain that starts with the letter 'G':
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%';

AND vs OR
The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions are TRUE.
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions are TRUE.

All Conditions Must Be True
The following SQL statement selects all fields from Customers where Country is "Germany" AND City is "Berlin" AND PostalCode is higher than 12000:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany'
AND City = 'Berlin'
AND PostalCode > 12000;

Combining AND and OR
You can combine the AND and OR operators.
The following SQL statement selects all customers from Spain that starts with a "G" or an "R".
Make sure you use parenthesis to get the correct result.
Select all Spanish customers that starts with either "G" or "R":

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');
Without parenthesis, the select statement will return all customers from Spain that starts with a "G", plus all customers that starts with an "R", regardless of the country value:
Select all customers that either:
are from Spain and starts with either "G", or
starts with the letter "R":

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%';

6.The SQL OR Operator
The WHERE clause can contain one or more OR operators.
The OR operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition, like if you want to return all customers from Germany but also those from Spain:
Select all customers from Germany or Spain:

SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany' OR Country = 'Spain';

At Least One Condition Must Be True
The following SQL statement selects all fields from Customers where either City is "Berlin", CustomerName starts with the letter "G" or Country is "Norway":
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City = 'Berlin' OR CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR Country = 'Norway';

7.SQL NOT Operator
The NOT Operator
The NOT operator is used in combination with other operators to give the opposite result, also called the negative result.
In the select statement below we want to return all customers that are NOT from Spain:
Select only the customers that are NOT from Spain:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country = 'Spain';

NOT LIKE
Select customers that does not start with the letter 'A':

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName NOT LIKE 'A%';
NOT BETWEEN
Select customers with a customerID not between 10 and 60:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 60;
NOT IN
Select customers that are not from Paris or London:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City NOT IN ('Paris', 'London');
NOT Greater Than
Select customers with a CustomerId not greater than 50:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT CustomerID > 50;
Note: There is a not-greater-than operator: !> that would give you the same result.

NOT Less Than
Select customers with a CustomerID not less than 50:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT CustomerId < 50;

8.SQL INSERT INTO Statement
The SQL INSERT INTO Statement
The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.

INSERT INTO Syntax
It is possible to write the INSERT INTO statement in two ways:
1. Specify both the column names and the values to be inserted:

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

2. If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, you do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query. However, make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table. Here, the INSERT INTO syntax would be as follows:
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');

CREATE TABLE software_employee(
    employee_id INT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    phone_number VARCHAR(15),
    job_title VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary INT
  );
  
INSERT INTO software_employee  
VALUES 
('1', 'sai', 'gulivindala', '9392751509', 'Devops Engineer', 'IT', 25000),
('2', 'ramesh', 'keerti', '8099166177', 'MLops Engineer', 'IT', 80000),
('3', 'Najana', 'Bhavani', '5556667777', 'System Engineer', 'Software', 40000);

SELECT * FROM software_employee;

Insert Data Only in Specified Columns
It is also possible to only insert data in specific columns.
The following SQL statement will insert a new record, but only insert data in the "CustomerName", "City", and "Country" columns (CustomerID will be updated automatically):
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Stavanger', 'Norway');

9.SQL NULL Values
What is a NULL Value?
A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.
If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.
A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!

How to Test for NULL Values?
It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.
We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.

IS NULL Syntax
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

IS NOT NULL Syntax
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

The IS NULL Operator
The IS NULL operator is used to test for empty values (NULL values).
The following SQL lists all customers with a NULL value in the "Address" field:
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address
FROM Customers
WHERE Address IS NULL;
Tip: Always use IS NULL to look for NULL values.

The IS NOT NULL Operator
The IS NOT NULL operator is used to test for non-empty values (NOT NULL values).
The following SQL lists all customers with a value in the "Address" field:

SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address
FROM Customers
WHERE Address IS NOT NULL;

9.SQL UPDATE Statement
The SQL UPDATE Statement
The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

UPDATE Syntax
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

Note: Be careful when updating records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be updated. 
If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!

UPDATE Table
The following SQL statement updates the first customer (CustomerID = 1) with a new contact person and a new city
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;

UPDATE Multiple Records
It is the WHERE clause that determines how many records will be updated.

The following SQL statement will update the ContactName to "Juan" for all records where country is "Mexico":

Example
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName='Juan'
WHERE Country='Mexico';

UPDATE software_employee 
SET salary = 45000
WHERE job_title = 'System Engineer';

Be careful when updating records. If you omit the WHERE clause, ALL records will be updated!

Example
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName='Juan';

10.SQL DELETE Statement
The SQL DELETE Statement
The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

DELETE Syntax
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Note: Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. 
If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!

DELETE FROM software_employee WHERE phone_number='5556667777';

Delete All Records
It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact:

DELETE FROM table_name;

The following SQL statement deletes all rows in the "Customers" table, without deleting the table:

Example
DELETE FROM Customers;
Delete a Table
To delete the table completely, use the DROP TABLE statement:
Remove the Customers table:
DROP TABLE Customers;

12.SQL TOP, LIMIT, FETCH FIRST or ROWNUM Clause
The SQL SELECT TOP Clause
The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.
The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.
Select only the first 3 records of the Customers table:

SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;
Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM.

SQL Server / MS Access Syntax:
SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

MySQL Syntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number;

Oracle 12 Syntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name(s)
FETCH FIRST number ROWS ONLY;

LIMIT
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:

Example
Select the first 3 records of the Customers table:

SELECT * FROM Customers
LIMIT 3;
FETCH FIRST
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:

Example
Select the first 3 records of the Customers table:

SELECT * FROM Customers
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
SQL TOP PERCENT Example
The following SQL statement selects the first 50% of the records from the "Customers" table (for SQL Server/MS Access):

Example
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
FETCH FIRST 50 PERCENT ROWS ONLY;
ADD a WHERE CLAUSE
The following SQL statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table, where the country is "Germany" (for SQL Server/MS Access):

Example
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany';
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
LIMIT 3;
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
ADD the ORDER BY Keyword
Add the ORDER BY keyword when you want to sort the result, and return the first 3 records of the sorted result.

For SQL Server and MS Access:
Sort the result reverse alphabetically by CustomerName, and return the first 3 records:

SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers
ORDER BY CustomerName DESC;
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY CustomerName DESC
LIMIT 3;

The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY CustomerName DESC
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;

13.SQL Aggregate Functions
SQL Aggregate Functions
An aggregate function is a function that performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value.

Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement. The GROUP BY clause splits the result-set into groups of values and the aggregate function can be used to return a single value for each group.

The most commonly used SQL aggregate functions are:

MIN() - returns the smallest value within the selected column
MAX() - returns the largest value within the selected column
COUNT() - returns the number of rows in a set
SUM() - returns the total sum of a numerical column
AVG() - returns the average value of a numerical column
Aggregate functions ignore null values (except for COUNT()).

We will go through the aggregate functions above in the next chapters.

14.SQL MIN() and MAX() Functions
The SQL MIN() and MAX() Functions
The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column.

The MAX() function returns the largest value of the selected column.

MIN ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Find the lowest price in the Price column:

SELECT MIN(Price)
FROM Products;
MAX Example
Find the highest price in the Price column:

SELECT MAX(Price)
FROM Products;

Set Column Name (Alias)
When you use MIN() or MAX(), the returned column will not have a descriptive name. To give the column a descriptive name, use the AS keyword:
SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice
FROM Products;
Use MIN() with GROUP BY
Here we use the MIN() function and the GROUP BY clause, to return the smallest price for each category in the Products table:
SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice, CategoryID
FROM Products
GROUP BY CategoryID;

15.SQL COUNT() Function
The SQL COUNT() Function
The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.
Find the total number of rows in the Products table:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Products;
Syntax
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Specify Column
You can specify a column name instead of the asterix symbol (*).

If you specify a column name instead of (*), NULL values will not be counted.

Example
Find the number of products where the ProductName is not null:

SELECT COUNT(ProductName)
FROM Products;
Add a WHERE Clause
You can add a WHERE clause to specify conditions:

Example
Find the number of products where Price is higher than 20:

SELECT COUNT(ProductID)
FROM Products
WHERE Price > 20;
Ignore Duplicates
You can ignore duplicates by using the DISTINCT keyword in the COUNT() function.

If DISTINCT is specified, rows with the same value for the specified column will be counted as one.

Example
How many different prices are there in the Products table:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Price)
FROM Products;
Use an Alias
Give the counted column a name by using the AS keyword.
Name the column "Number of records":

SELECT COUNT(*) AS [Number of records]
FROM Products;
Use COUNT() with GROUP BY
Here we use the COUNT() function and the GROUP BY clause, to return the number of records for each category in the Products table:

Example
SELECT COUNT(*) AS [Number of records], CategoryID
FROM Products
GROUP BY CategoryID;

16.SQL SUM() Function
The SQL SUM() Function
The SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column
Return the sum of all Quantity fields in the OrderDetails table:

SELECT SUM(Quantity)
FROM OrderDetails;

Add a WHERE Clause
You can add a WHERE clause to specify conditions:

Example
Return the sum of the Quantity field for the product with ProductID 11:

SELECT SUM(Quantity)
FROM OrderDetails
WHERE ProductId = 11;
Use an Alias
Give the summarized column a name by using the AS keyword.

Example
Name the column "total":

SELECT SUM(Quantity) AS total
FROM OrderDetails;
Use SUM() with GROUP BY
Here we use the SUM() function and the GROUP BY clause, to return the Quantity for each OrderID in the OrderDetails table:

Example
SELECT OrderID, SUM(Quantity) AS [Total Quantity]
FROM OrderDetails
GROUP BY OrderID;
You will learn more about the GROUP BY clause later in this tutorial.
SUM() With an Expression
The parameter inside the SUM() function can also be an expression.
If we assume that each product in the OrderDetails column costs 10 dollars, we can find the total earnings in dollars by multiply each quantity with 10:
Use an expression inside the SUM() function:

SELECT SUM(Quantity * 10)
FROM OrderDetails;
We can also join the OrderDetails table to the Products table to find the actual amount, instead of assuming it is 10 dollars:
Join OrderDetails with Products, and use SUM() to find the total amount:

SELECT SUM(Price * Quantity)
FROM OrderDetails
LEFT JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID;

17.SQL AVG() Function
The SQL AVG() Function
The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column.
Find the average price of all products:

SELECT AVG(Price)
FROM Products;
Note: NULL values are ignored.

Add a WHERE Clause
You can add a WHERE clause to specify conditions:

Example
Return the average price of products in category 1:

SELECT AVG(Price)
FROM Products
WHERE CategoryID = 1;
Use an Alias
Give the AVG column a name by using the AS keyword.

Example
Name the column "average price":

SELECT AVG(Price) AS [average price]
FROM Products;
Higher Than Average
To list all records with a higher price than average, we can use the AVG() function in a sub query:
Return all products with a higher price than the average price:

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM Products);
Use AVG() with GROUP BY
Here we use the AVG() function and the GROUP BY clause, to return the average price for each category in the Products table:

Example
SELECT AVG(Price) AS AveragePrice, CategoryID
FROM Products
GROUP BY CategoryID;
You will learn more about the GROUP BY clause later in this tutorial.

####################################################################################
SQL LIKE Operator
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

 The percent sign % represents zero, one, or multiple characters
 The underscore sign _ represents one, single character
 
Select all customers that starts with the letter "a":

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';

Return all customers from a city that starts with 'L' followed by one wildcard character, 
then 'nd' and then two wildcard characters:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE city LIKE 'L_nd__';

The % Wildcard
The % wildcard represents any number of characters, even zero characters.

Example
Return all customers from a city that contains the letter 'L':

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE city LIKE '%L%';

##########################################################################################

SQL Wildcards
SQL Wildcard Characters
A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters in a string.

Wildcard characters are used with the LIKE operator. The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

Return all customers that starts with the letter 'a':

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';

############################################################################################
The SQL IN Operator
The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.

The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Return all customers from 'Germany', 'France', or 'UK'

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');
#################################################################################
SQL BETWEEN Operator
The SQL BETWEEN Operator
The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.
The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. 
Selects all products with a price between 10 and 20:

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
###############################################################################
SQL Aliases
SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.
Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.
An alias only exists for the duration of that query.
An alias is created with the AS keyword.
SELECT CustomerID AS ID
FROM Customers;
##############################################################################
SQL JOIN
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
Different Types of SQL JOINs
Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
###############################################################################
INNER JOIN
The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.
We will join the Products table with the Categories table, by using the CategoryID field from both tables:
Join Products and Categories with the INNER JOIN keyword:

SELECT ProductID, ProductName, CategoryName
FROM Products
INNER JOIN Categories ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID;

The INNER JOIN keyword returns only rows with a match in both tables. Which means that if you have a product with no CategoryID, 
 or with a CategoryID that is not present in the Categories table, that record would not be returned in the result.
 It is a good practice to include the table name when specifying columns in the SQL statement.
Specify the table names:
SELECT Products.ProductID, Products.ProductName, Categories.CategoryName
FROM Products
INNER JOIN Categories ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID;
JOIN or INNER JOIN
JOIN and INNER JOIN will return the same result.

INNER is the default join type for JOIN, so when you write JOIN the parser actually writes INNER JOIN.
JOIN is the same as INNER JOIN:

SELECT Products.ProductID, Products.ProductName, Categories.CategoryName
FROM Products
JOIN Categories ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID;

JOIN Three Tables
The following SQL statement selects all orders with customer and shipper information:
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
FROM ((Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);
############################################################################
SQL LEFT JOIN Keyword
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), 
and the matching records from the right table (table2).
 The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match.
 SQL LEFT JOIN Keyword
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table (table2). The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match.

LEFT JOIN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
The following SQL statement will select all customers, and any orders they might have:
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
##############################################################################
SQL RIGHT JOIN Keyword
The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), 
and the matching records from the left table (table1). The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match.
The following SQL statement will return all employees, and any orders they might have placed:
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;
###############################################################################
SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Keyword
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.
Tip: FULL OUTER JOIN and FULL JOIN are the same
The following SQL statement selects all customers, and all orders:
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
#############################################################################
SQL Self Join
A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.
SQL Self Join Example
The following SQL statement matches customers that are from the same city:
SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City
ORDER BY A.City;
###########################################################################
The SQL UNION Operator
The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
The columns must also have similar data types
The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order
UNION ALL Syntax
The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL:

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
Note: The column names in the result-set are usually equal to the column names in the first SELECT statement.
The following SQL statement returns the cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;
#################################################################################
The SQL GROUP BY Statement
The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
SQL GROUP BY Examples
The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country:
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;
The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, sorted high to low:
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;

GROUP BY With JOIN Example
The following SQL statement lists the number of orders sent by each shipper:
SELECT Shippers.ShipperName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
GROUP BY ShipperName;
####################################################################################
The SQL HAVING Clause
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.
SQL HAVING Examples
The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country. Only include countries with more than 5 customers:
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;
The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, 
sorted high to low (Only include countries with more than 5 customers):
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;

The following SQL statement lists the employees that have registered more than 10 orders:

Example
SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM (Orders
INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID)
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 10;
#############################################################################
The SQL EXISTS Operator
The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.
The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records.
SQL EXISTS Examples
The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the suppliers with a product price less than 20:
SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price < 20);
############################################################################
The SQL ANY and ALL Operators
The ANY and ALL operators allow you to perform a comparison between a single column value and a range of other values.
The SQL ANY Operator
The ANY operator:
returns a boolean value as a result
returns TRUE if ANY of the subquery values meet the condition
ANY means that the condition will be true if the operation is true for any of the values in the range.
The SQL ALL Operator
The ALL operator:
returns a boolean value as a result
returns TRUE if ALL of the subquery values meet the condition
is used with SELECT, WHERE and HAVING statements
ALL means that the condition will be true only if the operation is true for all values in the range.
SQL ANY Examples
The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity equal to 10 (this will return TRUE because the Quantity column has some values of 10):

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ANY
  (SELECT ProductID
  FROM OrderDetails
  WHERE Quantity = 10);  
##################################################################################
The SQL SELECT INTO Statement
The SELECT INTO statement copies data from one table into a new table.
SELECT INTO Syntax
Copy all columns into a new table:
SELECT *
INTO newtable [IN externaldb]
FROM oldtable
WHERE condition;
SQL SELECT INTO Examples
The following SQL statement creates a backup copy of Customers:
SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup2017
FROM Customers;
####################################################################################
The SQL INSERT INTO SELECT Statement
The INSERT INTO SELECT statement copies data from one table and inserts it into another table.
The INSERT INTO SELECT statement requires that the data types in source and target tables match.
The existing records in the target table are unaffected.
Copy "Suppliers" into "Customers" (the columns that are not filled with data, will contain NULL):

INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers;
#######################################################################################
The SQL CREATE DATABASE Statement
The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new SQL database.
CREATE DATABASE databasename;

The SQL DROP DATABASE Statement
The DROP DATABASE statement is used to drop an existing SQL database.
DROP DATABASE databasename;
#########################################################################################
DROP DATABASE Statement
The DROP DATABASE statement is used to drop an existing SQL database.

Syntax
DROP DATABASE databasename;
#######################################################################################
SQL BACKUP DATABASE Statement
The BACKUP DATABASE statement is used in SQL Server to create a full back up of an existing SQL database.

BACKUP DATABASE databasename
TO DISK = 'filepath';

SQL BACKUP WITH DIFFERENTIAL Statement
A differential back up only backs up the parts of the database that have changed since the last full database backup.

BACKUP DATABASE databasename
TO DISK = 'filepath'
WITH DIFFERENTIAL;
#########################################################################################
SQL CREATE TABLE Statement
The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.
SQL CREATE TABLE Example
The following example creates a table called "Persons" that contains five columns: PersonID, LastName, FirstName, Address, and City:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    PersonID int,
    LastName varchar(255),
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Address varchar(255),
    City varchar(255)
);

Create Table Using Another Table
A copy of an existing table can also be created using CREATE TABLE.
The new table gets the same column definitions. All columns or specific columns can be selected.
If you create a new table using an existing table, the new table will be filled with the existing values from the old table.
CREATE TABLE TestTable AS
SELECT customername, contactname
FROM customers;
#############################################################################################
SQL DROP TABLE Statement
The DROP TABLE statement is used to drop an existing table in a database.
DROP TABLE table_name;
############################################################################################
SQL ALTER TABLE Statement
The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.
ALTER TABLE - ADD Column
ALTER TABLE Customers
ADD Email varchar(255);
ALTER TABLE - DROP COLUMN
To delete a column in a table, use the following syntax (notice that some database systems don't allow deleting a column):

ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;

SQL deletes the "Email" column from the "Customers" table:
ALTER TABLE Customers
DROP COLUMN Email;
ALTER TABLE - RENAME COLUMN
To rename a column in a table, use the following syntax:

ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME COLUMN old_name to new_name;
ALTER TABLE - ALTER/MODIFY DATATYPE
To change the data type of a column in a table, use the following syntax:

SQL Server / MS Access:

ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN column_name datatype;
My SQL / Oracle (prior version 10G):

ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;
###############################################################################
SQL constraints are used to specify rules for data in a table.

SQL Create Constraints
Constraints can be specified when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement, or after the table is created with the ALTER TABLE statement.
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype constraint,
    column2 datatype constraint,
    column3 datatype constraint,
    ....
);

SQL Constraints
SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.

Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted.

Constraints can be column level or table level. Column level constraints apply to a column, and table level constraints apply to the whole table.

The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:

NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly
#####################################################################################
SQL NOT NULL Constraint
By default, a column can hold NULL values.

The NOT NULL constraint enforces a column to NOT accept NULL values.

This enforces a field to always contain a value, which means that you cannot insert a new record, or update a record without adding a value to this field.

SQL NOT NULL on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL ensures that the "ID", "LastName", and "FirstName" columns will NOT accept NULL values when the "Persons" table is created:

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    Age int
);
SQL NOT NULL on ALTER TABLE
To create a NOT NULL constraint on the "Age" column when the "Persons" table is already created, use the following SQL:

SQL Server / MS Access:

ALTER TABLE Persons
ALTER COLUMN Age int NOT NULL;
My SQL / Oracle (prior version 10G):

ALTER TABLE Persons
MODIFY COLUMN Age int NOT NULL;
SQL UNIQUE Constraint
The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.

Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.

A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint.

However, you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.

SQL UNIQUE Constraint on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL creates a UNIQUE constraint on the "ID" column when the "Persons" table is created:

SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int
);
MySQL:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    UNIQUE (ID)
);
To name a UNIQUE constraint, and to define a UNIQUE constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CONSTRAINT UC_Person UNIQUE (ID,LastName)
);
SQL UNIQUE Constraint on ALTER TABLE
To create a UNIQUE constraint on the "ID" column when the table is already created, use the following SQL:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD UNIQUE (ID);
To name a UNIQUE constraint, and to define a UNIQUE constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD CONSTRAINT UC_Person UNIQUE (ID,LastName);
DROP a UNIQUE Constraint
To drop a UNIQUE constraint, use the following SQL:

MySQL:

ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP INDEX UC_Person;
SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP CONSTRAINT UC_Person;
####################################################################################
SQL PRIMARY KEY Constraint
The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.

Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.

A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields).

SQL PRIMARY KEY on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL creates a PRIMARY KEY on the "ID" column when the "Persons" table is created:

MySQL:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int
);
To allow naming of a PRIMARY KEY constraint, and for defining a PRIMARY KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CONSTRAINT PK_Person PRIMARY KEY (ID,LastName)
);
Note: In the example above there is only ONE PRIMARY KEY (PK_Person). However, the VALUE of the primary key is made up of TWO COLUMNS (ID + LastName).

ADVERTISEMENT

SQL PRIMARY KEY on ALTER TABLE
To create a PRIMARY KEY constraint on the "ID" column when the table is already created, use the following SQL:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD PRIMARY KEY (ID);
To allow naming of a PRIMARY KEY constraint, and for defining a PRIMARY KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Person PRIMARY KEY (ID,LastName);
Note: If you use ALTER TABLE to add a primary key, the primary key column(s) must have been declared to not contain NULL values (when the table was first created).
DROP a PRIMARY KEY Constraint
To drop a PRIMARY KEY constraint, use the following SQL:
MySQL:
ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP PRIMARY KEY;
SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP CONSTRAINT PK_Person;
####################################################################################
SQL FOREIGN KEY Constraint
The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.
A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.
Notice that the "PersonID" column in the "Orders" table points to the "PersonID" column in the "Persons" table.

The "PersonID" column in the "Persons" table is the PRIMARY KEY in the "Persons" table.

The "PersonID" column in the "Orders" table is a FOREIGN KEY in the "Orders" table.

The FOREIGN KEY constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, because it has to be one of the values contained in the parent table.
SQL FOREIGN KEY on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL creates a FOREIGN KEY on the "PersonID" column when the "Orders" table is created:

MySQL:

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);
SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);
To allow naming of a FOREIGN KEY constraint, and for defining a FOREIGN KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    CONSTRAINT FK_PersonOrder FOREIGN KEY (PersonID)
    REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);
SQL FOREIGN KEY on ALTER TABLE
To create a FOREIGN KEY constraint on the "PersonID" column when the "Orders" table is already created, use the following SQL:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

ALTER TABLE Orders
ADD FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID);
To allow naming of a FOREIGN KEY constraint, and for defining a FOREIGN KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:

MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

ALTER TABLE Orders
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_PersonOrder
FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID);
DROP a FOREIGN KEY Constraint
To drop a FOREIGN KEY constraint, use the following SQL:

MySQL:

ALTER TABLE Orders
DROP FOREIGN KEY FK_PersonOrder;
SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

ALTER TABLE Orders
DROP CONSTRAINT FK_PersonOrder;
#######################################################################################
SQL CHECK Constraint
The CHECK constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column.

If you define a CHECK constraint on a column it will allow only certain values for this column.

If you define a CHECK constraint on a table it can limit the values in certain columns based on values in other columns in the row.

SQL CHECK on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL creates a CHECK constraint on the "Age" column when the "Persons" table is created. The CHECK constraint ensures that the age of a person must be 18, or older:

MySQL:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CHECK (Age>=18)
);
#######################################################################################
SQL DEFAULT Constraint
The DEFAULT constraint is used to set a default value for a column.

The default value will be added to all new records, if no other value is specified.

SQL DEFAULT on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL sets a DEFAULT value for the "City" column when the "Persons" table is created:

My SQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    City varchar(255) DEFAULT 'Sandnes'
);
The DEFAULT constraint can also be used to insert system values, by using functions like GETDATE():
###########################################################################################
SQL CREATE INDEX Statement
The CREATE INDEX statement is used to create indexes in tables.
Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than otherwise. The users cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up searches/queries.
##########################################################################################
AUTO INCREMENT Field
Auto-increment allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table.

Often this is the primary key field that we would like to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.

Syntax for MySQL
The following SQL statement defines the "Personid" column to be an auto-increment primary key field in the "Persons" table:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    Personid int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    PRIMARY KEY (Personid)
);
MySQL uses the AUTO_INCREMENT keyword to perform an auto-increment feature.
By default, the starting value for AUTO_INCREMENT is 1, and it will increment by 1 for each new record.
To let the AUTO_INCREMENT sequence start with another value, use the following SQL statement:
ALTER TABLE Persons AUTO_INCREMENT=100;
############################################################################################
SQL Dates
The most difficult part when working with dates is to be sure that the format of the date you are trying to insert, matches the format of the date column in the database.

As long as your data contains only the date portion, your queries will work as expected. However, if a time portion is involved, it gets more complicated.

SQL Date Data Types
MySQL comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database:

DATE - format YYYY-MM-DD
DATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
TIMESTAMP - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
YEAR - format YYYY or YY
Now we want to select the records with an OrderDate of "2008-11-11" from the table above.

We use the following SELECT statement:

SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate='2008-11-11'
###############################################################################################
SQL CREATE VIEW Statement
In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

You can add SQL statements and functions to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.

A view is created with the CREATE VIEW statement. 

CREATE VIEW Syntax
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
Note: A view always shows up-to-date data! The database engine recreates the view, every time a user queries it.

SQL CREATE VIEW Examples
The following SQL creates a view that shows all customers from Brazil:

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
CREATE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
We can query the view above as follows:
SELECT * FROM [Brazil Customers];
The following SQL creates a view that selects every product in the "Products" table with a price higher than the average price:

CREATE VIEW [Products Above Average Price] AS
SELECT ProductName, Price
FROM Products
WHERE Price > (SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products);
We can query the view above as follows:
SELECT * FROM [Products Above Average Price];
################################################################################
SQL Data Types
SQL data types define the kind of values that can be stored in a database table column. They ensure data integrity and optimize storage.

1. Numeric Data Types
Used for storing numbers, including integers and decimals.
2. String (Character) Data Types
Used for storing text values.

Data Type	Size	Description
CHAR(n)	Fixed	Fixed-length text (1 to 255 characters)
VARCHAR(n)	Variable	Variable-length text (1 to 65,535 characters)
TEXT	Variable	Large text (up to 65,535 characters)
TINYTEXT	Variable	Small text (up to 255 characters)
3. Date and Time Data Types
Used for storing dates and timestamps.

Data Type	Format	Description
DATE	YYYY-MM-DD	Stores only the date
TIME	HH:MI:SS	Stores only the time
DATETIME	YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS	Stores date and time

4. Boolean Data Type
SQL does not have a direct BOOLEAN type, but it uses:
TINYINT(1), where 0 = FALSE and 1 = TRUE.
################################################################################
SQL Injection
SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.
SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.
SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.
##################################################################################
SQL Hosting
If you want your web site to be able to store and retrieve data from a database, your web server should have access to a database-system that uses the SQL language.
If your web server is hosted by an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you will have to look for SQL hosting plans.
The most common SQL hosting databases are MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and MS Access.
MySQL
MySQL is also a popular database software for web sites.
MySQL is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.
MySQL is an inexpensive alternative to the expensive Microsoft and Oracle solutions.
