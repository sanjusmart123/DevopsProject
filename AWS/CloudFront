cloudfront:

CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service operated by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that securely delivers website content, 
such as videos, images, and HTML files, to users worldwide. With CloudFront, data is cached at edge locations,
reducing latency and improving content delivery speeds. You can use CloudFront with Amazon S3, Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), and other AWS services. 
CloudFront also supports custom SSL certificates, HTTP/2, and headers for geo-distribution and security. By distributing your content closer to users, 
CloudFront can help reduce the latency and costs associated with delivering content across the globe.

Amazon CloudFront is a web service that gives businesses and web application developers an easy and cost 
effective way to distribute content with low latency and high data transfer speeds.

Latency:

Latency in AWS refers to the delay between the time a request is made and the time the response is received. 
This includes the time it takes for data to travel between your device and AWS services, as well as processing time within AWS. 
Low latency is crucial for applications that require real-time processing, such as gaming, video conferencing, and online collaboration.
AWS provides several tools and services to optimize latency, including Content Delivery Network (CDN), Lambda Functions, and Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS). 
Understanding latency in AWS is essential for designing and deploying high-performance applications.

Web Application Firewall:

You're referring to WAF (Web Application Firewall) in Amazon Web Services (AWS).
WAF is a web application security layer that filters and blocks malicious traffic to your website or application. 
It monitors HTTP requests and identifies the malicious traffic based on rules, such as IP addresses, HTTP headers, and query strings.
AWS WAF integrates with AWS CloudFront, Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), and Amazon API Gateway to protect your web applications from common web exploits and attacks.

Network access controll list in aws

To manage network access in AWS, you can use the Network Access Control List (NACL).
A NACL is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic to and from instances in a VPC(subnet level).
You can create and manage NACLs in the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs. 
A NACL is composed of rules, which are evaluated in order to determine whether traffic is allowed or denied.
You can create custom NACLs or use pre-configured ones to suit your network security needs. 
This allows you to have fine-grained control over traffic flow in your VPC.
